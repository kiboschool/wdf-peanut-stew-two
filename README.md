# Style the Recipe Site

You'll start with a plain HTML version of the recipe site. You'll add styles to make the site look amazing.

## Instructions

Add CSS to `style.css` to style the page. Try to avoid making too many changes to `index.html`. Adding links to fonts is encouraged.

Apply the Web Design concepts you've learned:

1. Style the text
2. Lay out and position the elements
3. Choose and apply colors

### Style the text

* Choose fonts and sizes for the body text
* Set the line spacing and line length appropriately
* Choose styles for the headings and emphasized text
* Choose styles for the lists and links

### Lay out and position the elements

* Check the spacing and line length
* Decide what elements should have normal flow, and what elements should flow differently
* Use display, flex, and position properties to position elements as designed.

### Choose and apply colors

* Choose nice, contrasting text color and background color
* Choose and apply accent and theme colors
* Try to use an accent color and a text-decoration property on the links. Style the link hover and visited states.
